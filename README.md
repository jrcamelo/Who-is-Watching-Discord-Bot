Who is Watching is a simple bot that integrates Discord with AniList.  
It helps with checking users' anime and manga scores, progress, status and more.  
It also warns about airing episodes of anime the users are watching.  

There is a focus on not being intrusive or breaking the conversation, with compact and deletable embeds.  

Made with discord.js, hosted on Vultr.
